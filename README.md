# indie-catalog

This repo contains a web components catalog that you can host yourself.
It's intended for companies that have private elements and would like
to host them, but those elements can't be published to something like
webcomponents.org.

## Step 0. Clone this repo.
```
git clone https://github.com/PolymerLabs/indie-catalog.git
cd indie-catalog
```

## Step 1. Configuration
The elements that you want to appear in the catalog are listed in `catalog.json`:

```
{
  "packages": {
    "an-element": { ... }
    "another-element": { ... }
  }
}
```

There's different setups you might be interested in:

### Elements with an accessible git repo
If you want to access the code from a git repo, use the `git` field:

```
{
  "packages": {
    "paper-input": {
       "git": "https://github.com/polymerelements/paper-input",
       "description": "A Material Design input"
    }
  }
}
```

This assumes that your demo will be accessible in a `demo` subfolder
of the git repo (i.e. `paper-input/demo/index.html`).

### Elements with externally hosted the demo and docs
If the demo and docs are already hosted in a different place, you can use the
`docs` and `demo` fields to link directly to them:
```
{
  "packages": {
    "paper-checkbox": {
      "description": "A Material Design checkbox with remote docs and demo",
      "demo": "https://raw-dot-custom-elements.appspot.com/PolymerElements/paper-checkbox/v2.0.0/paper-checkbox/demo/index.html",
      "docs": "https://www.webcomponents.org/element/PolymerElements/paper-checkbox"
    }
  }
}
```

You can also use these properties this if your element has a demo not
in a `/demo` subdirectory, but in some different directory, by using relative paths.
This relative path should look like `dist/{element-name}/bower_components/{element-name}/...`

```
"lazy-image": {
  "git": "https://github.com/notwaldorf/lazy-image",
  "description": "A custom image element that lets you load resources on demand",
  "demo": "dist/lazy-image/bower_components/lazy-image/index.html"    
}
```

#### Assumptions
For either usage, the following extra assumptions are made:
- running `bower install` in that repo completes successfully
- your element is written using relative paths for the elements it
depends on, rather than using `bower_components` anywhere. See
[PolymerElements/paper-button](https://github.com/PolymerElements/paper-button/blob/master/paper-button.html#L11) for an example.

## Step 2. Do the build dance.
This should take a while:

```
npm install
npm run build
```

If you're curious, this will be doing the following steps, for each package in `catalog.json`
with a git repo provided:
- `git clone` it to `/dist`
- remove the `.git` and `.gitignore` dirs from the clone
- `bower install` in `/dist/${elementName}/bower_components`
- copy the git clone into `/dist/${elementName}/bower_components/${elementName}`,
so that the demo works.

## Step 3. Run it locally

```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer # or your favourite local server
```
